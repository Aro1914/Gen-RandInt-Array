## Description

Gen-RandInt-Array is a helper function to help you generate an array with a length of your choice and given the min and max range as negPos

Compatible with both client-side and server-side environments.

## Usage

### Client-side and Server-side

Install the **Gen-RandInt-Array** package with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/):

```sh
npm install gen-randint-array
```

In your package.json, set "type" to "module" to enable you import a module.

```json
"type" : "module"
```

Or you can rename the javascript file the module is to be used to have the .mjs extension:

That is from `index.js` to `index.mjs`

Now when that is done, in your application code, import the **genRandIntArray()** method and assign the return value to a variable:

```js
import genRandIntArray from 'gen-randint-array';

const array = genRandIntArray(10, 10); //
```
